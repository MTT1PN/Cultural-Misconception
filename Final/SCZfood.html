        <h1>Food! Delicious food!</h1>
        
        <p>Santa Cruz delivers a huge menu of variety to whoever wants to try its cultural flavor. Soups are tipically the entry plates, the chicken soup is called "locro" since its usually made with chikens bought straight from the farms. And of course the main dishes, often referred as "segundos" (second in spanish) are the main atraction of our culinary traditions, like beef tongue with rice and salad, all under a spicy dressing called "Picante de Lengua" (Spicy Tongue).</p>
        <p>    
        But the most iconic plates that this department offers, of course, can't be ignored: Majadito and Sopa de Mani. DONT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THEM.</p>

        <h1> The Rythm of Santa Cruz</h1>
        <p>The music is very vivid, with guitars, drums (tamborita), violins and flautes, in certain regions like San Javier where the Jesuit Missions took place, the arp is also used. In times of Carnival celebration, this can be heard through the capital city.
